Version 1.1.0-1.7.10
The bedrock-surfaced Aberrant biome should no longer spawn in the Overworld
Added Immixer and combined potions
	The Immixer allows you to combine up to six potions (at once) into one potion with all effects
	With the right potions and emulsifier, you can create a potion with up to 10 effects
Crops harvested on land hydrated by ichor will have a small chance to increase their drops
Rifts now spread taint just like tainted nodes though at a significantly faster rate
There is now a random chance that an aberration will stumble through a Rift to the Overworld
Being in Xth'uoth slowly adds sticky warp to a player
    The chance to add sticky warp increases depending on the total warp you already have. Madness begets madness.
Added aspects to blocks, items, and entities
Should now work correctly on servers
Blighters now correctly destroy weak blocks such as snow and leaves
Added two creative only items: one that spawns a tainted node, and another that spawns and destroys rifts
	To spawn either a tainted node or a rift, simply right click on a block
	To destroy a rift, right-click it with the veil shears
More research has been added, some just information on pre-existing additions.
Crystal has been renamed Prysmal
You can infuse Prysmal shards at an arcane table with crystallized vis to make the primal elemental shards
Added Prysmal equipment
    Armor provides vis discount. The amount per armor changes depending on how many armor pieces the player has equipped
    Prysmal armor possesses an ability that is the opposite of Warping: Purifying. It will slowly remove sticky warp while worn
